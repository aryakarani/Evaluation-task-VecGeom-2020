# simplex sub-algorithm
Following is a function in 'closest.cc' , one of the fastest ways to find the closest point in a tetrahedron/triangle from any point in 3D space. This function is used in the GJK algorithm for collision detection of convex objects. Optimizing this simplex function helps in reducing the Time complexity of the GJK algorithm drastically.
